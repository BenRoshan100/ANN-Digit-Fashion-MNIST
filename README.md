## Overview
Deep learning has opened a new era on processing huge data fast. They are also open to process unstructured data such as image, audio and video. In this mini-project Artificial Neural Network has been implemented to classify handwritten digits and also fashion products. This technology is heavily used in Image classification and Object Detection.

## Motivation
This is my first Deep learning project. I have covered processing and building a model plus hyperparameter tuning to improve the accuracy of the model. Deep learning has been an area I have always been curious about. After doing much work in Machine Learning, I have decided to step into Deep Learning and will try to explore alot by getting my hands into the arena of neural networks

## Objectives of project
1. Exploratory Data Analysis of MNIST
2. Data preprocessing
3. Building Deep learning model(ANN)
4. Evaluation of model
5. Hyperparameter tuning of the model
